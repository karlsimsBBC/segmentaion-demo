# Segmentation Demo
Real-time image segmentation in the browser with TensorflowJS.

**(Live demo)[https://karlsimsbbc.github.io/segmentaion-demo/]**

Uses U-Net convolutional neural network trained with (laurentmih/aisegmentcom-matting-human-datasets)[https://www.kaggle.com/laurentmih/aisegmentcom-matting-human-datasets] dataset and built with keras.

Not really polished and needs some tweaking but does provides an example of model training and browser integration workflow. Was initially designed as a iteration on a personal project, (Hyper World Tour)[http://karl-cooper.co.uk/karlsims/hyperworldtour/].
